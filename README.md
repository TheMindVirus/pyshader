* Fully programmable shader model (even the parts which are usually closed source)
* Features two new (ported) types: `fixed2` and `fixed4` which allow use of variables with two names (e.g. f2.r f2.x)
* Future Work: Test the untested subscripts (e.g. f4.rgba f4.xyzw, f4.rgb f4.xyz, f2.xy f2.uv, etc...) and add new ones
